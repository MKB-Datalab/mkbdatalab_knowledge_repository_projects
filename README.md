## :bulb: Knowledge Repository Projects

Here we present several projects/tutorials that illustrates how data science techniques are applied and how they can benefit businesses.

These projects were inspired on projects developed by data science and entrepreneurship master students of [JADS](https://www.jads.nl/) at [JADS MKB Datalab](https://jadsmkbdatalab.nl/) 
while helping many SME's becoming more data driven.

Web scraping allows us to retrieve data stored on web pages across the Internet. This is a very handy skill for a data scientist since sometimes 
the data we need is not available via APIs or datasets.

In this project/tutorial we show that is possible to web scrape using few knowledge on HTML and with help 
of Python packages [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) and [`BeautifulSoup`](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/). We extract 
text, information from tables, and also from hyperlinks within a webpage.

Since data is what we get from web scraping the applications are endless. They go from a business, to governmental, until personal applications.

In this tutorial we give an overview of how to use APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to retrieve data. Via API one is able to retrieve real time 
data as well as historical data. An example of interesting business application involves combining real time data together with historical data to predict  demand of products.

We start this tutorial with some basics on JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files which are standard form for transferring data through APIs. After that we start exploring 
some APIs starting by a simple one: The [Open Movie database (OMDb) API]( http://www.omdbapi.com/). Then we take a look on how to get information from both 
[NS]( https://apiportal.ns.nl/) and KNMI Weer APIs ([Weerlive]( https://weerlive.nl/delen.php) and [meteoserver]( https://meteoserver.nl/)).
To close it we check out how to pull data from [Twitter]( https://twitter.com/home?lang=en).
