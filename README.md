## :bulb: Knowledge Repository Projects

Here we present several projects/tutorials that illustrates how data science techniques are applied and how they can benefit businesses.

These projects were inspired on projects developed by data science and entrepreneurship master students of [JADS](https://www.jads.nl/) at [JADS MKB Datalab](https://jadsmkbdatalab.nl/) 
while helping many SME's becoming more data driven.

* Brief description and/or bullet list with main points 

	- Web scraping allows us to retrieve data stored on web pages across the Internet. This is a very handy skill for a data scientist since sometimes 
the data we need is not available via APIs or datasets.
	- In this project/tutorial we show that is possible to web scrape using few knowledge on HTML and with help 
of Python packages [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) and [`BeautifulSoup`](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/). We extract 
text, information from tables, and also from hyperlinks within a webpage.
	- Since data is what we get from web scraping the applications are endless. They go from a business, to governmental, until personal applications. ¬†
